# Moving on 

I'm delighted to announce that, from the beginning of March, I'll be moving on from HED/UHB Informatics to join the National Patient Safety Team at NHS England/NHS Improvement in March, as Patient Safety Lead - System Analysis and Delivery. Looking forward to applying my PhD work at national level & leading new developments in #patientsafety
analysis.
