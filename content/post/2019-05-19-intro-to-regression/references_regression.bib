  abstract = {SUMMARY In the light of an increasing interest in the accountability of public institutions, this paper sets out the statistical issues involved in making quantitative comparisons between institutions in the areas of health and education. We deal in detail with the need to take account of model-based uncertainty in making comparisons. We discuss the need to establish appropriate measures of institutional 'outcomes' and base-line measures and the need to exercise care and sensitivity when interpreting apparent differences. The paper emphasizes that statistical methods exist which can contribute to an understanding of the extent and possible reasons for differences between institutions. It also urges caution by discussing the limitations of such methods.},

Written for researchers with little or no background in advanced statistics, the book presents treatments of all major models using numerous tables, insets, and detailed modeling suggestions. It begins by demonstrating the fundamentals of modeling count data, including a thorough presentation of the Poisson model. It then works up to an analysis of the problem of overdispersion and of the negative binomial model, and finally to the many variations that can be made to the base count models. Examples in Stata, R, and SAS code enable readers to adapt models for their own purposes, making the text an ideal resource for researchers working in health, ecology, econometrics, transportation, and other fields.},

  abstract = {During the past century, manufacturing industry has achieved great success in improving the quality of its products. An essential factor in this success has been the use of Walter A Shewhart's pioneering work in the economic control of variation, which culminated in the development of a simple yet powerful graphical method known as the control chart. This chart classifies variation as having a common cause or special cause and thus guides the user to the most appropriate action to effect improvement. Using six case studies, including the excess deaths after paediatric cardiac surgery seen in Bristol, UK, and the activities of general practitioner turned murderer Harold Shipman, we show a central role for Shewhart's approach in turning the rhetoric of clinical governance into a reality.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To ascertain hospital inpatient mortality in England and to determine which factors best explain variation in standardised hospital death ratios. Design: Weighted linear regression analysis of routinely collected data over four years, with hospital standardised mortality ratios as the dependent variable. Setting: England. Subjects:Eight million discharges from NHS hospitals when the primary diagnosis was one of the diagnoses accounting for 80\% of inpatient deaths. Main outcome measures: Hospital standardised mortality ratios and predictors of variations in these ratios. Results: The four year crude death rates varied across hospitals from 3.4\% to 13.6\% (average for England 8.5\%), and standardised hospital mortality ratios ranged from 53 to 137 (average for England 100). The percentage of cases that were emergency admissions (60\% of total hospital admissions) was the best predictor of this variation in mortality, with the ratio of hospital doctors to beds and general practitioners to head of population the next best predictors. When analyses were restricted to emergency admissions (which covered 93\% of all patient deaths analysed) number of doctors per bed was the best predictor. Conclusion: Analysis of hospital episode statistics reveals wide variation in standardised hospital mortality ratios in England. The percentage of total admissions classified as emergencies is the most powerful predictor of variation in mortality. The ratios of doctors to head of population served, both in hospital and in general practice, seem to be critical determinants of standardised hospital death rates; the higher these ratios, the lower the death rates in both cases.\%U http://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/318/7197/1515.full.pdf},

	doi = {10/gb3r9t},
	abstract = {Objectives To develop a transparent and reproducible measure for hospitals that can indicate when deaths in hospital or within 30 days of discharge are high relative to other hospitals, given the characteristics of the patients in that hospital, and to investigate those factors that have the greatest effect in changing the rank of a hospital, whether interactions exist between those factors, and the stability of the measure over time.Design Retrospective cross sectional study of admissions to English hospitals.Setting Hospital episode statistics for England from 1 April 2005 to 30 September 2010, with linked mortality data from the Office for National Statistics.Participants 36.5 million completed hospital admissions in 146 general and 72 specialist trusts.Main outcome measures Deaths within hospital or within 30 days of discharge from hospital.Results The predictors that were used in the final model comprised admission diagnosis, age, sex, type of admission, and comorbidity. The percentage of people admitted who died in hospital or within 30 days of discharge was 4.2\% for males and 4.5\% for females. Emergency admissions comprised 75\% of all admissions and 5.5\% died, in contrast to 0.8\% who died after an elective admission. The percentage who died with a Charlson comorbidity score of 0 was 2\% in contrast with 15\% who died with a score greater than 5. Given these variables, the relative standardised mortality rates of the hospitals were not noticeably changed by adjusting for the area level deprivation and number of previous emergency visits to hospital. There was little evidence that including interaction terms changed the relative values by any great amount. Using these predictors the summary hospital mortality index (SHMI) was derived. For 2007/8 the model had a C statistic of 0.911 and accounted for 81\% of the variability of between hospital mortality. A random effects funnel plot was used to identify outlying hospitals. The outliers from the SHMI over the period 2005-10 have previously been identified using other mortality indicators. Conclusion The SHMI is a relatively simple tool that can be used in conjunction with other information to identify hospitals that may need further investigation.},
