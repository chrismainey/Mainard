<div id="ah-pivots" class="section level1">
<h1>Ah, pivots…</h1>
<p>So, ‘pivots’ have been part of my life in data analysis since my first interview, where I missed the point of the test (to make a pivot) and manually filtered loads of Excel data until I got there. Managed to get the job though (nothing to do with the sympathy vote for the broken shoulder I had at the time, of course …).</p>
<p>They are so easy to build in Excel, a real pain in SQL (as you need to specify the column names, or make it dynamic), but thank heavens for the <code>tidyr</code> package. Now, I’m not the first to suggest it could be a bit confusing, but I got my head around <code>spread()</code> and <code>gather()</code> and was a happy bunny. Then they changed it… Hadley Wickham and contributors made the wise choice to adopt the phrase ‘pivot’ in <code>pivot_wider()</code> and <code>pivot_longer()</code>. So I felt like a right idiot when I couldn’t figure it out…. I took the sensible approach of ignoring it until they forced my hand by removing it.</p>
<p>That said, I was working on a solution in some consultancy work today, and I needed to pivot the data but also to leave a strong markdown documentation trail. I felt it would have been a bit unfair if I left them with <code>spread()</code> knowing it would go the way of the Dodo soon. This brief post is just showing a working bit of pivot for my own memory and anyone else who’s interested.</p>
<p>I’m pivoting the <code>NHSRdatasets</code> <code>LOS_models</code> data.frame for organisation by columns, and applying function. This could be <code>mean()</code> or <code>meadian()</code> or similar, but I defined a function to add some Poisson distributed noise.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(NHSRdatasets)

data(&quot;LOS_model&quot;)

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

set.seed(123) # For reproducibility

LOS_model %&gt;% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = ID
              , names_from = Organisation
              , values_from = LOS
              , values_fill = list(LOS = 0)
              , values_fn = list(LOS= function(x){x+ rpois(n = 1, lambda = 3)})

<h2>Bonus round:</h2>
<p>I remember hearing Tom Jemmett <a href="https://twitter.com/tomjemmett"><span class="citation">@tomjemmett</span></a> talk about the magic of <code>purrr</code>. Now I’m a bit slow off the mark with <code>purrr</code> because I couldn’t see why it was different to <code>apply</code> functions. Now I’ve hear more about it, I can see there’s more consistency and it allows some nice applications of functions. The thing that was <em>really</em> nice though was <strong><em>anonymous functions</em></strong>! They look so much cleaner, and are defined as a one-sided formula. I’ve replaced the aggregate function with an anonymous one in the example below:</p>

  pivot_wider(id_cols = ID
              , names_from = Organisation
              , values_from = LOS
              , values_fill = list(LOS = 0)
              , values_fn = list(LOS= ~ . + rpois(n = 1, lambda = 3))
