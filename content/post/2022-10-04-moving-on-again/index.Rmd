# Quick job update

Looking at my last post on here, it was the start of my previous role at NHSE.  Show's you how much time I've had for extracurricular things like a website, eh?  Ah well, hopefully more posts this year.

I've recently moved from NHSE's national patient safety team to NCL ICB, to lead the specialist analytics team.  Excited for new challenges, and I've learnt a huge amount from my time at 'the centre,' and looking forward to applying it somewhere new.
