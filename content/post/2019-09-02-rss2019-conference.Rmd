# Royal Statistical Society (RSS) Conference 2019
<br>
## Talk: Using funnel plots and CUSUM techniques to monitor hospital-standardised mortality

I'm speaking this week at the Royal Statistical Society Conference, on 5th September, at Belfast ICC.
Quite excited about this one, as I learnt so much from the RSS conference last year.  I'm in the 'Hospital Outcomes' session in the afternoon.

If you have an interest, it would be great to see you there.  I'll also be name dropping my `FunnelPlotR` package, no doubt! https://chrismainey.github.io/FunnelPlotR/
