  abstract = {SUMMARY In the light of an increasing interest in the accountability of public institutions, this paper sets out the statistical issues involved in making quantitative comparisons between institutions in the areas of health and education. We deal in detail with the need to take account of model-based uncertainty in making comparisons. We discuss the need to establish appropriate measures of institutional 'outcomes' and base-line measures and the need to exercise care and sensitivity when interpreting apparent differences. The paper emphasizes that statistical methods exist which can contribute to an understanding of the extent and possible reasons for differences between institutions. It also urges caution by discussing the limitations of such methods.},

  abstract = {This entry-level text offers clear and concise guidelines on how to select, construct, interpret, and evaluate count data. Written for researchers with little or no background in advanced statistics, the book presents treatments of all major models using numerous tables, insets, and detailed modeling suggestions. It begins by demonstrating the fundamentals of modeling count data, including a thorough presentation of the Poisson model. It then works up to an analysis of the problem of overdispersion and of the negative binomial model, and finally to the many variations that can be made to the base count models. Examples in Stata, R, and SAS code enable readers to adapt models for their own purposes, making the text an ideal resource for researchers working in health, ecology, econometrics, transportation, and other fields.},

  abstract = {During the past century, manufacturing industry has achieved great success in improving the quality of its products. An essential factor in this success has been the use of Walter A Shewhart's pioneering work in the economic control of variation, which culminated in the development of a simple yet powerful graphical method known as the control chart. This chart classifies variation as having a common cause or special cause and thus guides the user to the most appropriate action to effect improvement. Using six case studies, including the excess deaths after paediatric cardiac surgery seen in Bristol, UK, and the activities of general practitioner turned murderer Harold Shipman, we show a central role for Shewhart's approach in turning the rhetoric of clinical governance into a reality.},
