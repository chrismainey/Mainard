<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> What is overdispersion?</h1>
<p>This post discusses ‘overdispersion’ (‘OD’ in this post), a term commonly seen when using count data (such as the NHS mortality indicator <a href="www.digital.nhs.uk/SHMI">SHMI</a>. I will discuss what it is, how it affects our data and our interpretations as well as some options for dealing with it. It is related to an earlier post on <a href="https://mainard.co.uk/post/introduction-to-funnel-plots/">Funnel plots</a>, as these plot need adjustment in the presence of OD. It will help explain the adjustment used in that post, as well as other (and in my opinion, better) approaches.</p>
<p>To understand the context, we have to think about count data. Count data are real, numeric values (sometimes referred to as ‘discrete’), they can only be whole numbers. They are bounded at (cannot go below) zero. So we can have a count of 2 or 3, but not 2.5, and we can have 0 or more events, but not -1 events.</p>
<p>These properties of counts mean that they are naturally skewed (the distribution is not symetrical) when the mean count is low. They are therefore not normally distributed (see below).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(123)
dist &lt;- data.frame(Normal1 = rnorm(1000, 1, 2),
                   Normal2 = rnorm(1000, 2, 2),
                   Normal5 = rnorm(1000, 5, 2),
                   Normal10 = rnorm(1000, 10, 2),
                   Poisson1 = rpois(1000, 1),
                   Poisson2 = rpois(1000, 2),
                   Poisson5 = rpois(1000, 5),
                   Poisson10 = rpois(1000, 10)
)

<p>They are commonly modelled using the Poisson distribution. Forgive the mathsy description, but it’s the best way:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Pr(Y = y) = \frac{\mu^y e^-\mu^\lambda }{y!}\]</span></p>
<p>When transformed into a Poisson regression, we end up modelling the expected count <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, ususllay through a log transformation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ ln(\mu) = \alpha + \beta x\]</span></p>
<p>In the exquation above we have no separated error term, and size of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is also it’s variance.
This means that the variance cannot be different. Unless we have perfectly behaved Poisson data,and few things in real life are perfectly behaved, our variance will not be quite right. The upshot of this is that the assessment of parameter signficance, and model accuracy will be affected.</p>
<p>We usually observe ‘overdispersion’, where there is more variance in our data than the Poisson distribtuion assumes. This means that we underestiamte our error, and overestimate the signficance of parameters. There are a lot of different way to deal with this. Our choice of technique depends on our assumptions, the data generating mechinsm and what we want to use the model for.</p>
<p>Overdispersion generally arises from one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insufficent predictors in the model (bad model)</li>
<li>Poorly parameterised model (bad preparation)</li>
<li>Aggregation of data</li>
<li>Correlations in data / violations of the ‘independence’ assumption</li>
</ul>
<p>1 &amp; 2 can be solved by having more, and better quality data. Sometimes this is possible, but often it’s not. Aggreagation is sometimes neccisary because we don’t have the underlying data, or we are building panel models based on counts etc.</p>

<p>Where it’s not to change our data structure and processing, we can try some of the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Ignore it!</li>
<li>Scale the variance an manually re-calculate</li>
<li>Quasi-likelihood models</li>
<li>Mixture models:</li>
<li>Zero-inflated models</li>
<li>Negaive Binomial models</li>
<li>Models for clusterd data:</li>
<li>Generalized Estimating equations</li>
<li>Random-Intercept models</li>
</ol>
<div id="ignore-it" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Ignore it:</h2>
<p>The Poisson distribution is (helpfully) known to be unbiased, so unless we need to considered the signficance of parameters, we might be fine ignoring it. If our data doesn’t violate regression assumptions, and we are using it for predictions or parameter estimates, we are fine.</p>
