<h2>Talk: Using funnel plots and CUSUM techniques to monitor hospital-standardised mortality</h2>
<p>I’m speaking this week at the Royal Statistical Society Conference, on 5th September, at Belfast ICC.
Quite excited about this one, as I learnt so much from the RSS conference last year. I’m in the ‘Hospital Outcomes’ session in the afternoon.</p>
<p>If you have an interest, it would be great to see you there. I’ll also be name dropping my <code>FunnelPlotR</code> package, no doubt! <a href="https://chrismainey.github.io/FunnelPlotR/" class="uri">https://chrismainey.github.io/FunnelPlotR/</a></p>
