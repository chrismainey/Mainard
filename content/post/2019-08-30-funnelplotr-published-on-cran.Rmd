# FunnelPlotR 0.2.0 released!

I've published my package for creating funnel plots of indirectly standardised ratios.
It's awesome!  It allows you to make overdispersion adjustments, draws plots and labels outliers in `ggplot2`.

I will update my post on here to the new function soon, but you can find it at:

- CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FunnelPlotR/index.html
- Package Site: https://chrismainey.github.io/FunnelPlotR/
