<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> FunnelPlotR 0.3.1 released!</h1>
<p><code>FunnelPlotR</code> has just been released to CRAN with major updated. I’m quite proud of this one, as I feel I’ve tackled some statistical issues, change package to use <code>R</code>s S3 system (new one for me), reorganised it a lot and made it more robust.</p>
<p>From the NEWs file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significantly reorganised the internals into more small functions</li>
<li>Added methods for ratios of counts and proportions</li>
<li>Renamed several arguments - please read the help file!</li>
<li>Added S3 object system and associated methods</li>
<li>Added ‘themes’ as people don’t like the <code>ggplot2</code> grey as default</li>
<li>Added ability to change colours</li>
<li>Broke process into much smaller functions for easier editing and speed</li>
<li>Tweaked vignettes for new methods and added new one showing plot options</li>
<li>Removed unnecessary <code>rlang</code> dependency</li>
</ul>
<p>Download it from CRAN now: <code>install.packages("FunnelPlotR")</code></p>
