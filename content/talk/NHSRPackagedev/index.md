abstract: This session will why you might want to build an `R` package and how to do.  We'll do the majority of it practically, building a package during the session, and we'll release the latest version of my `FunnelPlotR` package to show the process of releasing to CRAN.  We'll use the RStudio tools, `devtools`, `usethis`, `testthat` and `roxygen2` packages to help automate most of it for us.
We will cover: R package structures, what a function is and how to convert your code to it, inserting a `roxygen2` skeleton and writing documentation, dependencies, building and checking, and we'll also give a nod to source control via Git and GitHub, along with unit testing with `testthat`.
