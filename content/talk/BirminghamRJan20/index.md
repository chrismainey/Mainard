abstract: Healthcare Evaluation Data (HED) is an online NHS benchmarking using national data. We provide
  web-based interactive reporting tools for organisations to compare performance, featuring various statistical   modelling approaches and live manipulation of large datasets. We have relied on SAS for many of our models,
  but are transitioning to R for modelling, analysis work and developing support material.  This talk will
  explain how we are moving from one keen user, to wider adoption, focussing on
  
  Setting up R in a ‘locked-down’ NHS environment
  
  Best practise for building statistical models on large data sets with limited hardware
  
  Spreading use of R through package development and training
  Encouraging R use for analysis and ad-hoc reporting
  Open-source principles, information governance and intellectual property
  Barriers we have faced include scepticism about security risks, unhelpful hardware and network settings, a
  perception that R was not fit for production, fear of losing SAS as the ‘standard,’ and the learning curve for
  new R users.
  We have embarked on a structured training program for our teams and have set up a local R user group.
  We are aiming to further engage with the R community as user confidence grows.

summary: A lightning talk tour of why `mgcv` is awesome, including what regression models are, options for dealing with non-linear relationships, what splines are, and how we can use splines in a Generalized Additive Modle (GAM).  Simon Wood's excellent `mgcv` package makes this easy to build and fit.
