abstract: This short presentation and panel discussion on 'data science on a budget.' I'll join Christian Last (https://christinalast.com/) to discus to topic. i suspect we'll touch on how you can make progress without the funding, infrastructure, or well-developed teams that you might have in a larger commercial organisations. I'll talk about our journey in the HED team at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS FT, and where we want to go.
