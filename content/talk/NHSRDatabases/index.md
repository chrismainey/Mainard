abstract: This session will explain a little about the structure of SQL connections that are often hidden from analysts in proprietary software, but need to be understood them to use them in `R`.  We'll look a little at SQL, how to use `RODBC` and, my preference `DBI`.  We look at how to send and return SQL queries, and how to plug `dplyr` into `dbplyr` and have it write SQL for us!
