#  Summary 

+ Count data
+ Poisson model
+ Over-dispersion
	+ Scaling
	+ Mixture models
	+ Multi-level models
+ I use R mostly, so most examples will be in R!

---
#  R Evangelism?. 

+ R is an open-source statistical programming language
	+ Free
	+ Collaborative
+ One of the leading data science languages
+ Thousands of `packages`, often written by researchers
+ Integrates well with other environments
+ Can write into `markdown` or `kniter` documents or embed in web-players using `Shiny`
+ Strong graphical capabilities

**Want to predict Y, using X:**
$$ y = \alpha + \beta x + \varepsilon$$
+ $\alpha$<U+F061> = Intercept
+ $\beta$ = Coefficient (how much x affects y)
+ $\varepsilon$= Error (Residual)

+ This is a linear regression, which has an exact solution. The solutions discussed in the following slides are more complicated as they are estimated, with no exact solution.

#  Count data 

+ My PhD work is related counts of ?incidents? reported in NHS hospitals
	+ Poorly recorded
	+ Few obvious predictors
+ Counts are common in health and economic data, (often ?panel? data)
+ Usually formed from aggregates:
	+ Attenders at a clinic
	+ Number of readmission to hospital etc.

---
#  Properties of count data 

+ Discrete
	+ E.g. 10 or 11 patients, but not 10.5
+ Range from zero to infinity
	+ Usually can?t have a negative count
+ Occur in a fixed time period, with a known average rate.
+ Not normally distributed

---
#  Poisson Distribution 

+ Probability of count occurring in a fixed interval:
+ where *<U+F06D>* is the expected average count, is Euler?s number (the base of the natural logarithm: ~2.71828), and is the factorial of .
+ Depending on notation used, ? is often <U+03BB> , and used interchangeably.

#  Poisson Distribution, increasing mean count 

![](assets/img/image6.png)

---


---
#  Basic Poisson count models 

+ **Generalized linear model (GLM):**
+ is the expected , ** is a link-function from the exponential family of distributions, is the th row of a model matrix and *<U+F062>* is a vector of unknown parameters (model coefficients) (Wood, 2017).
+ **Poisson model:**
+ With is the intercept, model coefficient of predictor for line of model matrix .  This extends to predictor variables.

---
#  What is overdispersion (OD)? 

+ Poisson dist. assumes  Mean = variance
+ If variance > mean, Poisons model will underestimate the variance:
	+ SE & CIs too small, ?Significance? overstated
+ Many mechanisms, including:
	+ Mis-specification (lack of predictors, poorly parameterised)
	+ Presence of outliers
	+ Variation between response probabilities

---
#  Testing for overdispersion 

+ Ratio of sum of squared Pearson residuals to residual degrees of freedom
	+ Approximately distributed
+ Number of R functions:
	+ AER::dispersiontest()
	+ s jstats::overdisp()
+ Home-brewed:

sum(residuals(model, type="pearson")^2) / model$df.residual

---
#  Options with Poisson models: 

+ Fit simple model and ignore OD
+ Fit model, then use techniques to scale/estimate OD and correct
	+ Robust SE  or Bootstrap
+ Use a model that accounts for this:
	+ Scaled Poisson or related
	+ Complex variance structure

---
#  Robust SE 

+ One method is to use the ?sandwich? variance estimators, proposed by Huber.
+ ?Robust? option in Stata, few lines of code in R

l ibrary(sandwich)

cov.m1 <- **vcovHC** (m1, type="HC0")

std.err <- **sqrt** ( **diag** (cov.m1))

r.est <- **cbind** (Estimate= **coef** (m1), "Robust SE" = std.err, "Pr(>|z|)" = 2 * **pnorm** ( **abs** ( **coef** (m1)/std.err), lower.tail=FALSE), LL = **coef** (m1) - 1.96 * std.err, UL = **coef** (m1) + 1.96 * std.err)

#  Bootstrap 

+ Resampling with replacement ? (Efron 1979)
+ Create sampling distribution of mean
+ Handy, because this is normally distributed (if parametric bootstrap)
+ R: ?boot? package or ? car::Boot ? is a convenience wrapper for glm.

---
#  Additive Random effects (Spiegelhalter, 2005a) 

+ Development of work for meta-analysis (DerSimonian and Laird 1986)
+ Used by CQC (CQC, 2014)
+ Transform to z-scores
+ Assess distribution and truncate (?Winsorization?)
+ Calculated difference in variance
+ Presented as adjusted z-scores or by adjusting control limits on SPC chart.

---
#  Funnel plot with OD-adjusted limits 

+ Funnel control limits at 2 & 3 s in left panel, inflated by additive scale factor t 2 in right panel
![](assets/img/image10.png)

---
#  Scaling 

+ Scale residual variance
	+ Quasi-Poisson
	+ Mixture models
+ Quasi-likelihood (Nelder & Wedderburn 1979)
	+ Simpler mean-variance relationship, not full distribution
	+ Estimating Equations, as no likelihood to maximise
	+ Built-in ?family? in R, use:
		+ ??family=?quasipoisson??

---
#  ?Mixture? models (Cameron & Trivedi, 2013), (Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal, 2012) 

+ Two distributions used
+ ?Between? & ?Within? variance
+ Commonly Negative Binomial (NB1)
	+ NB1 group-specific mean, multiplicative
	+ NB2 gamma/Poisson, quadratic
+ Weight the mean differently, NB2 gives higher weight to smaller counts

---
#  Other scaled models 

+ Generalized Poisson ?  more complex scale factor
+ Conway-Maxwell Poisson ? distribution on scale factor
+ glmmTMB, COMPoisson, VGAM
+ Various assumptions about mean/variance
	+ All authors have particular cases in mind.
	+ Challenging to know why one is better

---
#  Mixture > Mixed Models (Goldstein 2010) 

+ Sometimes a model structure has implicit levels
+ Variance can be partitioned between levels:
	+ E.g. patients within GP practises submitting to a trial
	+ Patients followed up at several points over time
+ Breaks the normal regression assumption of ?independence? and ?homoscedasticity
	+ Can lead to OD

---
#  Mixed models (simplified) 

+ As per glms, but with extra component for variance:

With structure similar to GLMs, but with an additional parameter: , the random effect, for *j* th cluster.  Random effects are assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and a dispersion matrix depending on unknown variance components (Breslow and Clayton, 1993 )

No additional <U+F062> , but variance component J

#  R options 

+ l me4: glmer is the most common package, but many others, including:
	+ MASS::glmmPQL
	+ MCMCglmm
	+ glmmTMB::glmmTMB
	+ Stan

m1 <- glmer(y~x+(1|f),data=d,family=poisson)

---
#  Other options 

+ Principle Components / Factor Analysis
+ Generalised Additive Models
+ Tree-based models / Random Forests

---
#  PCA general principle 

+ Assume that variables are proxies for underlying ?components,? e.g.
	+ Multiple questions in psychological questionnaires
+ Rank how much variance each components explain
+ ?Rotate? axis to components and use ?loadings? to examine which components correlate with predictors

---
#  Generalised Additive Models (Hastie &Tibshirani, 1986) 

+ Smooth functions of variables:
+ Lost of options for smoothers:
	+ Cubic Spline
	+ Thin-plate Splines
	+ Tensor products
+ Need to estimate degree of smoothness and penalty term

---
#  What is a Spline? 

+ Piecewise polynomials
+ Joined at ?knot-points?
	+ Continuous at second-derivative
+ Represented as basis functions

(Wood 2017)
![](assets/img/image14.png)

---
#  GAMs 

+ In R, most popular package mgcv  (Wood, 2017)
	+ mgcv::gam(y ~ s(x, bs=?cr?))
	+ s() is a smoother construct
+ Estimates smooth parameters as part of model
+ Parametric terms can still be used
+ Random Effects can be included if simple
	+ Called by gamm4 or gamm (using lme4 or nlme )

---
#  Choosing the number of knots (k) 

+ k=10, Natural-cubic spline
+ -  Reasonable smooth fit
+ k=20, Natural-cubic spline
+ - Too ?wiggly?
+ AIC of glm = 5638.552, 	 AIC(k=10) = 5603.204, 	 AIC(k=20) = 5585.923
+ **Beware of over-fitting smoothers based on AIC alone!**
+ gam( numvisit ~ badh + (age , bs =? cr ?, k=?), data= badhealth , family =" poisson ")
![](assets/img/image15.png)


---
#  GAM Pros and Cons 

+ Smooth functions often represent data better than raw values
+ Requires choosing a smoother, R can estimate parameters including knots and penalty
+ Can reduce overdispersion due to noise
+ Can be heavy on degrees of freedom
+ Need to be careful of over-fitting
+ More complex regression mechanisms

---
#  Random Forests (1)  (Breiman, 2001)  

+ Regression Trees (Breiman et al 1984) : rpart
	+ partition on greatest variance
+ Tendency to over-fit
	+ Early stopping (pruning) used
	+ Cross-validated
+ fit<-rpart(Price ~ Mileage + Type + Country, cu.summary )
+ rpart.plot(fit)
![](assets/img/image16.png)

---
#  Random Forests (2) 

+ Combine tree-based methods with Bootstrapping
	+ Random sample of both data & parameters
+ Pros and cons:
	+ Predict very well
	+ Less likely to over-fit
	+ Linearity or distribution not really an issue
+ Hard to visualise/understand
	+ Not able to use random effects

---
#  How do we compare them? 

+ ??All models are wrong, but some are useful?? (George Box)
+ For models with a likelihood:
	+ AIC (Akaike, 1998)   - AIC(), or part of summary() , bbmle package has nice ICtab function and QAIC
	+ Likelihood ratio test for nested models (Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal, 2012)
	+ Beware the boundary effect!
	+ Marginal or Conditional (Greven & Kneib, 2010) cAIC4 and mgcv packages
+ Prediction Error ? caret, ModelMetrics packages
	+ Root Mean Squared error
	+ Mean Absolute Error
+ ?Significance??  -  Not well defined
	+ lme4 authors regard significance test for random effects as wrong, due to distribution

---
#  Best options for Incident data? 

+ Definite clustering:
	+ Random-intercepts
+ Collinearity / Noisy data
	+ Generalised Additive Models
+ Marginal model ? use additive-OD model
